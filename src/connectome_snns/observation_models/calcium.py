r"""Calcium observation model: render spike trains into predicted dF/F traces.

This is a *forward* (observation) model, not a neural simulator. It takes a
network's spikes and renders the dF/F trace a calcium indicator would produce,
so the network can be trained in observable space — fitting the measured dF/F
directly, with no spike-deconvolution step in between.

Forward model (per cell)::

    a           = (1 + gamma) * gain           # peak ΔF/F per spike
    c[t]        = gamma * c[t-1] + a * s[t]     # latent calcium; s[t] = spikes in frame t
    pred_dff[t] = b0 + c[t]                     # observed dF/F

- ``gamma`` — AR(1) decay of the indicator, ``gamma = exp(-dt / tau)``. Taken
  from the literature for the indicator and (at present) shared across cells.
- ``a = (1 + gamma) * gain`` — the measured gain is ``var/mean = a/(1+gamma)``,
  so the per-spike *peak* jump is ``(1 + gamma) * gain``. Do **not**
  unit-normalise the kernel: gain is peak ΔF/F per spike, not integrated area.
  Dropping the ``(1 + gamma)`` makes every rendered transient ~``(1+gamma)``×
  too small (≈2× for a slow indicator) and the network silently mis-scales its
  firing to compensate.
- ``b0`` — resting dF/F. Defaults to 0: the cells are active almost all the
  time, so the true silent baseline is unobservable; we adopt the data's
  8th-percentile zero as the model's zero and let ongoing spiking explain the
  elevated level of each trace. This is a convention, not a claim that rest sits
  at zero. ``b0`` is exposed per cell so a different convention can be supplied.
- **No noise term** — the model predicts the *expected* (noise-free) dF/F.
  Measurement noise lives in the residual the loss is fitting; injecting it here
  would only corrupt the target.

class CalciumObservationModel(nn.Module):
    r"""AR(1) calcium forward (observation) model — renders spikes to dF/F.

    The model is **stateful**: the latent calcium ``c[t-1]`` is carried across
    successive ``forward`` calls so a long recording can be rendered
    chunk-by-chunk (as in chunked training). Because AR(1) dynamics are
    Markovian, carrying this single latent reproduces the full-recording trace
    exactly. Call :meth:`reset_state` at the start of each independent sequence.
    The carried latent is detached between chunks (truncated BPTT through time),
    matching the convention in ``VanRossumLoss``.

    Parameters are predefined (not learned) and per cell, so different cells —
    and, in future, different cell types — can carry different gain, baseline,
    and kinetics. ``gain``, ``tau`` and ``baseline`` may each be a scalar (shared
    across cells) or a per-cell 1-D tensor of length ``n_cells``.

    Args:
        gain: Measured per-cell gain (``var/mean``). Scalar or ``(n_cells,)``.
            The per-spike *peak* dF/F is ``(1 + gamma) * gain``.
        tau: Indicator decay time constant in ms (``gamma = exp(-dt / tau)``).
            Scalar or ``(n_cells,)``. Held constant across cells at present;
            pass a per-cell tensor to model cell-type-specific kinetics.
        dt: Frame interval in ms.
        baseline: Per-cell resting dF/F ``b0``. Scalar or ``(n_cells,)``.
            Defaults to 0.0 (the 8th-percentile-zero convention).
        trainable_baseline: If True, ``baseline`` becomes a learnable
            ``nn.Parameter`` (pass a per-cell init) instead of a fixed buffer, so
            the optimiser can place each cell's resting dF/F. Default False.
