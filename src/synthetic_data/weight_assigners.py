"""Assign continuous weights to graph edges.

This module provides functions to assign continuous weight values to signed
adjacency matrices while preserving Dale's law (excitatory/inhibitory signs).

Typical workflow:
    >>> from src.utils.topology_generators import sparse_graph_generator
    >>> adj, types = sparse_graph_generator(n_nodes=100, p=0.1)
    >>> weights = assign_weights_lognormal(adj, mean=0.0, std=1.0)
