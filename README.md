# Connectome-Constrained SNN Models

PyTorch-based research code modelling dynamical connectomics datasets with SNNs.

## Environment

We recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

You should manually sync your environment with either CPU or GPU support:

```bash
# For CPU
uv sync --extra cpu

# For GPU
uv sync --extra gpu
```
